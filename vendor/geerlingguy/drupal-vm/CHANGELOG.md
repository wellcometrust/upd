# Drupal VM Changelog


## 4.9.2 (2019-01-03)

### Breaking Changes

  * Ubuntu 14.04 is still supported as long as the LTS release is receiving security updates, but some functionality may start breaking for Ubuntu 14.04, as more and more upstreams are dropping support for the old Ubuntu version.

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * #1774: `vagrant_box` was changed to `geerlingguy/drupal-vm`. This box is faster to start in all cases, and should work fine even when switching between Apache/Nginx or MySQL/PostgreSQL. You can always override and switch back to `geerlingguy/ubuntu1604` or whatever base box you prefer.

### Improvements

  * #1760: Add test and support for Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver.

## 4.8.0 "Tower Music / Let Us Pray" (2018-01-30)

This release is all about Drush. Please read my blog post [Drupal VM 4.8 and Drush 9.0.0 - Some major changes](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/drupal-vm-48-and-drush-900-some-major-changes) for details and more background.

If you have Drush 8 installed on your host machine, primarily use Drush _outside_ of Drupal VM, and don't use a Drush make file, none of the breaking changes should affect you.

### Breaking Changes

  * Drush is no longer installed inside Drupal VM if you have `drush` in `installed_extras`. Drush Launcher is installed by default.
  * The `drush_version` configuration option is no longer used by default.
  * Drush make files cannot be built with Drush 9+. If you have `drupal_build_makefile: true` in your `config.yml`, you _must_ add configuration to install an older version of Drush inside Drupal VM. See the [Drupal VM Drush make docs](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/deployment/drush-make/).

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * Added the following variables to support Drush 9:
    * `drush_aliases_host_template_yml: "templates/drupalvm.aliases.yml.j2"`
    * `drush_aliases_guest_template_yml: "templates/drupalvm-local.aliases.yml.j2"`
  * Removed now-unused variable: `drush_version: "8.1.15"` (Drush Launcher is installed by default inside Drupal VM).

### Improvements

  * #1672: Upgrade Drupal VM to use Drush Launcher and natively support Drush 9.0.0.
  * #1595: Create Drush global aliases that work for Drush 9+ and work outside Drupal VM.
  * Updated roles: drush.

### Bugfixes

N/A


## 4.7.2 (2018-01-29)

### Breaking Changes

N/A

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * #1624: Added `beet/box` to list of recommended base boxes (for faster Ubuntu 16.04 provisioning).
  * #1668: Fixed some comments which had incorrect variable references.
  * Updated `drush_version` to `"8.1.15"` (was `"8.1.14"`).

### Improvements

  * Updated roles: drush.

### Bugfixes

  * #1659: Mention changes required for CentOS when using specialized synced folder methods.
  * #1539: Update Drush role so Drush installs correctly on Debian 8 and 9.


## 4.7.1 (2018-01-23)

### Breaking Changes

N/A

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * #1617: Fix typos in PHP.md


## 4.7.0 "Water, Music, and Tronaction" (2017-10-06)

### Breaking Changes

  * In Issue #1520, the precedence of configuration override files was changed slightly. Previously, `[environment].config.yml` overrode all other configuration files, including `local.config.yml`. The intention of the local config file is that it is always the final override. The order of config file precedence (from lowest to highest) is now:
    1. `config.yml`
    2. `secrets.yml`
    3. `[environment].config.yml`
    4. `local.config.yml`

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * Removed `geerlingguy/ubuntu1204` support (LTS support ended in April).
  * Default `vagrant_hostname` is now `drupalvm.test` (Google owns `.dev` and some DNS issues have forced us to switch to `.test` as the default).
  * Added `drupal_db_host: localhost` to fix a DB connection issue with Debian 9 'Stretch'.
  * Added `headers.load` to `apache_mods_enabled`.
  * Updated `drush_version` to `8.1.14`.
  * Updated example `post_provision_scripts` path to include the full `playbook_dir`-based path.

### Improvements

  * #1551: Add PHP 7.2 support via php-versions role.
  * #1427: Use drupalvm.test for local development default.
  * #1521: Remove Ubuntu 12.04 support, officially.
  * #1521: Install Ansible with pip if provisioning inside the VM.
  * #1527: Revamp dashboard for better layout, especially on mobile.
  * #1476: Update Drupal role to speed up initial Drupal project generation.
  * #1487: Install mod_headers for Apache by default.

  * #1520: Let local.config.yml override environment.config.yml.
  * #1564: Allow spaces in `DRUPALVM_ANSIBLE_ARGS` to make it more useful.
  * #1560, #1558: Various improvements to test scripts.
  * #1451: Bump the Drupal VM Docker image base to Debian 9 'Stretch'.
  * #1451: Add full support and automated tests for Debian 9 'Stretch'.
  * #1504: Display (this may take a while) for long-running Composer tasks.
  * #1507: Use https URL to download Adminer.
  * #1495: Update Drupal role so composer install can be skipped on deploy.
  * #1573: Update default Drupal version to 8.4.x, Drush to 8.1.14.
  * Updated roles: postgresql, firewall, nginx, php-pecl, mysql, varnish, ruby, adminer, nodejs, php, php-versions.

### Bugfixes

  * #1456: Default Docker example uses incorrect image.
  * #1481: Use absolute paths for example post_provision_scripts.
  * #1468: Fix various Linux issues with NFS by defaulting to TCP.
  * #1508: Switch to using localhost for MySQL so install-drupal works on Debian 9.
  * #1540: Fix incorrect IP address in some docs.
  * #1558: Update Daemonize role to work on Ubuntu 14.04 with Ansible 2.4.
  * #1572: Fix broken link to Drupal Console documentation.


## 4.6.0 "Water, Music, and Tronaction" (2017-06-28)

### Breaking Changes

  * If you have `varnish` in your `installed_extras`, then the newest version of the Varnish role included in this release changes the Varnish package repository (on all OSes) to use the latest supported Varnish packages from Varnish's official packagecloud.io repos. This allows you to specify Varnish versions anywhere from the latest (currently 5.1) to early 2.x versions (and everything in-between)... but you might either have to uninstall Varnish before updating existing VMs, or just rebuild your VM to take advantage of the latest role version.

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * `vagrant_box` still defaults to Ubuntu 16.04, but you can now use Debian 9 ('Stretch') if you set the variable to `geerlingguy/debian9`.
  * `vagrant_plugins` was added (see #1378), and contains a list of Vagrant plugins that—if not already installed—will be installed for use by Vagrant.

### Improvements

  * #1455: Update Varnish role to allow for Varnish 5.1, 5.0, and any older version.
  * #1451: Document the availability of `geerlingguy/debian9` base box (and Docker base container).
  * #1378: Automatically install a configurable list of Vagrant plugins (`hostsupdater` and `vbguest` by default).
  * #1423: Add documentation on using the official Docker image for quick Drupal testing environments.
  * #1388, #1389: Use `geerlingguy/drupal-vm` docker image by default in Docker Compose file.
  * #1437: Allow list of paths in `pre_provision_tasks_dir` and `post_provision_tasks_dir` (used to just be one path maximum).
  * #1443: Add IRC badge linking to `#drupal-vm` freenode IRC room on Riot.
  * #1171: Support using XDebug to debug Drush commands inside Drupal VM.
  * #1368: Ensure private filesystem works correctly when using Nginx.
  * #1375: Allow /vagrant default synced folder to be managed like other synced folders.
  * #1406: Minor doc improvement for using Tideways instead of XHprof when using PHP 7+.
  * #1431: Minor doc improvement for `composer docker-bake` command.
  * #1386: Remove dated Acquia example and point to BLT's configuration instead.
  * #1418: Allow PHP configuration to be overridden so default system packages can be used instead of Ondrej Sury's repo (allowing PHP 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 to be used when absolutely necessary).
  * #1424: Add support for RFC 5785 (`.well-known`) when using Nginx.
  * #1451: Use 192.168.89.89 for default Docker Drupal VM IP.
  * Updated roles: PostgreSQL, PHP Versions, Redis, Nginx, Varnish.

### Bugfixes

## 4.5.0 "Break In (For Strings, Flutes, and Celesta)" (2017-05-24)

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * Changed variables:
    * `nodejs_version: "6.x"` (was `0.12`)
  * New variables:
    * Reconfigurable templates for Drush Aliases:

      * `drush_aliases_guest_template: "templates/drupalvm-local.aliases.drushrc.php.j2"`
    * Reconfigurable template for Nginx hosts:
      * `nginx_vhost_template: "templates/nginx-vhost.conf.j2"`
    * `firewall_enabled: true` (allows the disabling of Drupal VM's default firewall, e.g. for Docker usage)
    * `php_xdebug_remote_host: "{{ ansible_default_ipv4.gateway }}"` (prevents warnings when using Xdebug)

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * `firewall_disable_firewalld: true` and `firewall_disable_ufw: true` to ensure the system default firewalls are disabled on CentOS and Ubuntu, respectively (we set up our own rules, so this prevents weird problems).

### Improvements

  * #1123: Add Tideways support and updated documentation for use.
  * #1107: Allow additions to PHP packages via php_packages_extra.

## 4.1.0 "Anthem" (2016-12-30)

### Breaking Changes

  * N/A

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * There's a new `apache_vhost_php_fpm_parameters` variable that defines the PHP-FPM handler Apache uses per-virtualhost. The old `extra_parameters` pre-4.1.0 will continue to work, but the new `SetHandler` technique is better for most scenarios than using `ProxyPassMatch`.
  * The Dashboard entry in `nginx_hosts` now has `is_php: true`.

### Improvements

## 4.0.0 "We've Got Company" (2016-12-10)

### Breaking Changes

  * Vagrant 1.8.6 or later, VirtualBox 5.1.10 or later, and Ansible 2.2.0 or later (if installed on host) are now required.
  * PHP 7.0 is still the default, but **you can install PHP 7.1**, or **switch to PHP 5.6** on-the-fly, thanks to #1043—on any supported OS! See the updated docs: [Using other versions of PHP](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/other/php/)
