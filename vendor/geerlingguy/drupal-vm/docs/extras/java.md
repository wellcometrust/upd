Java will automatically be installed if you enabled any of the `installed_extras` that depend on it.
If you have any other use case for installing it, just make sure `java` is in the list of `installed_extras` in your `config.yml`.

For a list of available role variables, see the [`geerlingguy.java` Ansible role's README](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-java#readme).
