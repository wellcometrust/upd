If you have [Drush](http://www.drush.org) and Ansible installed on your host workstation, and would like to interact with a Drupal site running inside Drupal VM, there are drush aliases automatically created by Drupal VM for each of the virtual hosts you have configured.

> Note: Drush 9.0.0 and later require some architectural changes to the way Drush is installed and used both within Drupal VM and on your host computer. Please check the [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues) and [Drupal VM](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-vm/issues) issue queues if you encounter any strange behavior when using Drush.

With the example configuration, you can manage the example Drupal site using the Drush alias `@drupalvm.test`. For example, to check if Drush can connect to the site in Drupal VM, run:

```
$ drush @drupalvm.test status
 Drupal version         :  8.0.0-dev
 Site URI               :  drupalvm.test
 Database driver        :  mysql
 Database hostname      :  localhost
 Database port          :
 Database username      :  drupal
 Database name          :  drupal
 Database               :  Connected
 Drupal bootstrap       :  Successful
 Drupal user            :  Anonymous
 Default theme          :  bartik
 Administration theme   :  seven
 PHP executable         :  /usr/bin/php
 PHP configuration      :  /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
 PHP OS                 :  Linux
 Drush script           :  /usr/local/share/drush/drush.php
 Drush version          :  7.0-dev
 Drush temp directory   :  /tmp
 Drush configuration    :
 Drush alias files      :
 Drupal root            :  /var/www/drupalvm/drupal
 Site path              :  sites/default
 File directory path    :  sites/default/files
 Temporary file         :  /tmp
 directory path
 Active config path     :  [...]
 Staging config path    :  [...]
```

Drupal VM automatically generates a drush alias file in `~/.drush/drupalvm.aliases.drushrc.php` (for Drush < 9.0.0) and `~/.drush/sites/drupalvm.site.yml` (for Drupal 9.0.0+) with an alias for every site you have defined in the `apache_vhosts` or `nginx_vhosts` variable.

If you want to customize the generated alias file you can override the `drush_aliases_host_template` and `drush_aliases_guest_template` variables (or `_yml` variables for Drush 9.0.0+) in your `config.yml`.

```yaml
drush_aliases_host_template: "{{ config_dir }}/templates/drupalvm.aliases.drushrc.php.j2"
```

Eg. to only print the alias for your main domain, and not the subdomain you can override the file using a [Jinja2 child template](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#child-template).

```php
{% extends 'templates/drupalvm.aliases.drushrc.php.j2' %}

{% block aliases %}
{{ alias('drupalvm.test', drupal_core_path) }}
{% endblock %}
```

You can disable Drupal VM's automatic Drush alias file management if you want to manage drush aliases on your own. Just set the `configure_drush_aliases` variable in `config.yml` to `false`.

## Using sql-sync

_For sql-sync to work between two remotes make sure you are running Drush 8.0.3 or later on your host and your guest machine, as well as 7.1.0 or later on the remote._

If you're locked to an older version of Drush, it is likely that Drush will try to run the command from the `@destination` instead of from your host computer, which means you need to move your `@remote` alias to Drupal VM as well. You can place the file in any of the [directories Drush searches](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/5a1328d6e9cb919a286e70360df159d1b4b15d3e/examples/example.aliases.drushrc.php#L43:L51), for example `/home/vagrant/.drush/<remote-alias>.aliases.drushrc.php`.

If you're still having issues, you can avoid `sql-sync` entirely and pipe the mysqldump output yourself with:

```
drush @remote sql-dump | drush @drupalvm.drupalvm sql-cli
```

## Running `drush core-cron` as a cron job.

Using the `drupalvm_cron_jobs` list in `config.yml` you can configure your VM to automatically run cron tasks eg. every 30 minutes.

```yaml
drupalvm_cron_jobs:
  - name: "Drupal Cron"
    minute: "*/30"
    job: "{{ drush_path }} -r {{ drupal_core_path }} core-cron"
```

_Cron jobs are added to the vagrant user's crontab. Keys include name (required), minute, hour, day, weekday, month, job (required), and state._
