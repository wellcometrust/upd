Many different words are used to describe the same thing, and many of those words are unnecessarily technical (for example pseudonymised, key-coded, de-identified for limited disclosure).  This acts as a significant barrier to discussing the use of data with the public in ways that can build both understanding and confidence.</p><p>We think that an important part of improving conversations about patient data is getting the words right, in a way that is accurate but also accessible and meaningful. If everyone is on the same page in using these words, itâ€™ll be easier for clinicians, patients, researchers and the public to have informed discussions about how patient data is used and why.</p>'
